# cljs-socketcluster

You can run `yarn shadow-cljs compile app` to make `server.js` in your directory.
For testing type `yarn shadow-cljs watch app` and run `node server` in a separete terminal window.

This project is imitating the https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster/tree/master/app library `app` folder, 
only it is translated to _clojurescript_.

Thanks to https://gist.github.com/jjsullivan5196/0904057a2ec3eb080de5c4d6f45da630 for making this possible.
